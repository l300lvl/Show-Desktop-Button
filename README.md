This is my first Gnome Shell Extension.

The idea of this was taken from the MGSE Window List as a proof of concept, and for the fun of learning how js works with Gnome Shell, it has been a great learning curve already.

### Description: 

Places a button to the left of the Window List to hide all windows, and the overview when active, and show the current desktop(credit: MGSE, erguille, madkristoff, mbokil). 

v9: *New icon(thanks madkristoff!)* Position setting in prefs tool. todo: tray option 3.6, icon setting, compat w/show desktop from overview extension.
